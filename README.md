## About Random Things

Random Things is a miscellaneous mod that adds a diverse collection of utility items, blocks, and gameplay enhancements. It includes features such as automated item collection, crop growth acceleration with Fertilized Dirt, a personal pocket dimension called the Spectre Dimension, Spectre Coils for wireless energy transfer, Divining Rods for locating ores, various redstone utilities, decorative blocks, and numerous quality-of-life improvements. The mod is designed to complement other mods by adding convenience features and new gameplay without adhering to a specific theme. To put it in Lumien's words:

> Random Things is a collection of features that i thought would be neat. The mod doesn't really have a central topic so it's best played alongside other mods.

The goal of Quantum Things is to provide continued support for Random Things, such as new features, bug and crash fixes, and compatibility with other mods, while saying true to the original design goal and intent of the mod.

## Developing

The workspace and setup are inherited from Lumien231's Random Things repository. The workspace is completely and utterly fucked up and ancient, so builds may randomly fail for no discernible reason. Sometimes, when the build does succeed, when loading the game some textures will be missing. If this happens, just rebuild. If the workspace becomes broken in some way, run `unfuck_workspace.bat` to reset the workspace. This is also helpful when you first cloned the repository and you want to set up the workspace from scratch.

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues, please report them to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MagicJinn/Quantum-Things/issues). Do **not** report issues to the original Random Things repository. Lumien231 is no longer actively developing Random Things, and new issues on the original repository are unlikely to be addressed.
